# Jokenpo API (Rock Paper Scissors)

A simple REST API built with **Kotlin + Spring Boot** that allows a player to play Rock–Paper–Scissors against the machine.

The player sends a move via HTTP request, the server randomly chooses a move, and the API responds with the result.

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"move":"PEDRA"}'
```

---

---

## Error Handling

If the player sends an invalid move:

```json
{
  "move": "TEST"
}
```

```json
{
  "message": "Invalid move. Valid options are: PEDRA, PAPEL, TESOURA."
}
```

Status code:

```
400 Bad Request
```

---

## Game Logic

The core game rule is implemented inside the `Move` enum:

```kotlin
fun winsAgainst(opponent: Move): Boolean
```

The service layer:

1. Randomly selects a machine move
2. Compares both moves
3. Returns the result
